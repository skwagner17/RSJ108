Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Find Your Topic and a Compelling Focus</h3>
              <p>To have a good foundation, you must find a compelling topic to write about. For a feature story, find an interesting person, group, or place that interests you and would attract the attention of your audience. There needs to be a purpose behind the story and it is supposed to highlight an achievement or a compelling component of their lifestyle.</p>

              <h3>Do Your Research and Be Observant</h3>
              <p>A feature is an in-depth look at a person, place, or event, so it requires a lot of background information. Research about their history or what this person or group has achieved in their life. It will also help you formulate the right questions to ask during interviews and it will make you as the interviewer look more professional since you have done the proper research beforehand.</p>

              <h3>Schedule and Conduct an In-Person Interview</h3>
              <p>If possible, organize an in-person interview so you can get to know the person, and ideally conduct the interview at their home or workplace. Being in a person’s environment you get a better feel for who they are, and you can use descriptions of the setting in your piece. Prior to the interview, have the basic and most important questions that you want to ask but make sure to branch out from these questions depending on where the interview goes. Ask follow-up questions and use the moments of silence! The best answers can come from these awkward moments of silence in between answers.</p>

              <h3>Have a Good Story Structure, a Beginning, Middle, and an Ending</h3>
              <p>Whereas news ledes focus on the facts, the 5 Ws and H, the opening paragraph of a feature lede sets up the scene or describes a person or location in vivid detail. Following the lede is the nut graph, and it’s here you get to tell the reader what it’s all about—in a nutshell. It’s a bridge between the lede and body and tells us why the story was written and why we need to care. The middle part or body of the feature must have all the usual building blocks of a story, the setting, scenes, action, conflict or challenge, and character building. Feature stories also need some type of conclusion, so the reader feels they’ve been following a complete story. Often when interviewing a source, they’ll casually toss out the perfect end-quote or opening line for your piece, which would tie your story perfectly together in the end.</p>
